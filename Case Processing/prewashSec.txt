<s>Instead, she argues generally only that, "[i]n this case, the very existence of the contract and the circumstances surrounding the obtaining of it are so grossly oppressive as to require relief".</s>
<s>As mentioned earlier in this opinion, the dispute-resolution program provides procedures by which a dispute may be resolved by the parties, without first resorting to arbitration.
