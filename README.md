# Legal-Treebank-Dev
This is the repository for developing the Legal Treebank. This is strictly preliminary development work. We will transition to a different repo once we move out of development.

This repository is part of a project being developed by the LegalRnD - The Center for Legal Services Innovation at Michigan State University College of Law. The project, named the "Legal Treebank Project," focuses on developing an English language annotated corpus of appellate court decisions. 

The Legal Treebank Dev repository is a development site for the project. At some point, we will move the project from development to production and establish a repository with a corpus available generally to users. In other words, accept this repository for what it is - an iside view to us making the sausage.

Because this is a development site, much of the work may be done offline. We will push updates to the online repo periodically. But, what you see here may not be the latest version of the Project materials.
