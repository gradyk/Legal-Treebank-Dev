# Legal-Treebank-Dev
This is the repository for developing the Legal Treebank. This is strictly preliminary development work. We will transition to a different repo once we move out of development.

This repository is part of a project being developed by the LegalRnD - The Center for Legal Services Innovation at Michigan State University College of Law. The project, named the "Legal Treebank Project," focuses initially on developing a "ground truth" annotated corpus of U.S. appellate court decisions. 

The Legal Treebank Dev repository is a development site for the project. At some point, we will move the project from development to production and establish a repository with a corpus available generally to users. In other words, accept this repository for what it is - an inside view to us making the sausage.

Because this is a development site, much of the work will be done offline. We will push updates to the online repo periodically. But, what you see here may not be--better said, will not be--the latest version of the Project materials.
