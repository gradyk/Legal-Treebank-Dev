<p n="17"><s n="60" type="issue">The Leemans argue that, like the plaintiff in Branch, they had no right to negotiate the terms of the termite agreement and that they would not have been able to find a termite-control agreement with another pest-control provider comparable to the termite agreement without assenting to an arbitration provision. </s><s n="61" type="fact">In support of their argument, the Leemans produced portions of a record in another case that included copies of various pest-control agreements from five other pest-control providers, all of which contain an arbitration provision. </s><s n="62" type="issue">This, they argue, "establishes that at the time the Leemans signed the [termite agreement], nearly every other pest-control company in Alabama also required its consumers to agree to mandatory, binding, pre-dispute arbitration." </s><s n="63" type="issue">Thus, they maintain, Cook's Pest Control had overwhelming bargaining power and they had no meaningful choice in the transaction. </s><s n="64" type="analysis">We disagree.</s></p>

<p n="18"><s n="65" type="analysis">The consumer in Branch, by providing evidence indicating that of the 16 available loan providers in her geographical area, 8 were sampled and only 1 of those offered a loan without requiring the borrower to assent to an arbitration provision, demonstrated that she could not obtain a loan without assenting to an arbitration provision. </s><s n="66" type="analysis">The Leemans, on the other hand, have presented evidence indicating only that five of the untold total number of pest-control-service providers available to the Leemans in the Birmingham metropolitan area required the consumer to assent to an arbitration agreement. </s><s n="67" type="analysis">Because the Leemans do not provide the total number of pest-control-service providers available to them, this Court is unable to conclude that the Leemans could not have secured a termite-control agreement without considerable expenditure of time and resources. </s><s n="68" type="holding">Therefore, they have not met their burden on this issue.</s></p>

Corp.-Alabama v. Boone, 838 So.2d 370, 373 (Ala.2002) (holding, in part, that the plaintiffs made no showing that they lacked a meaningful choice because the record did not demonstrate the plaintiffs attempted to "shop around" for a contract that did not call for arbitration); Green Tree Fin. Corp. of Alabama v. Vintson, 753 So.2d 497, 504 (Ala.1999) (holding as "meritless" the argument that the plaintiffs had no meaningful choice in assenting to arbitration because they failed to "present evidence indicating that they could not have independently secured financing by an agreement that would not have required arbitration"); and Pitchford v. AmSouth Bank, 285 F.Supp.2d 1286, 1295 (M.D.Ala.2003) ("Although a party would not have to spend a considerable amount of time and effort to find alternatives, Alabama Courts, nevertheless, do require that a party 'shop around' in order to show that there was no meaningful alternative.").</lawcit></p>

<p n="20"><s n="72" type="issue">The Leemans argue, however, that under Anderson they were not required to actually "shop around" for a termite-control agreement that lacked an arbitration provision. </s><s n="73" type="analysis">Their argument misstates our holding in Anderson. </s><s n="74" type="analysis">In that case, we noted: "[T]he facts of this case do not logically present an issue whether the Ashbys should have 'actually shopped around' for a lender that would not require that they execute an arbitration agreement. </s><s n="75" type="analysis">The Ashbys' inability to read the documents and agent Anderson's alleged failure to mention the 'arbitration agreement' when he undertook and purported to explain the documents to them deprived the Ashbys of any reason to 'shop around' for such a lender." </s><lawcit>Anderson, 873 So.2d at 179. </lawcit><s n="76" type="analysis">Thus, we did not in Anderson reach the issue whether a party must "shop around" for an agreement that does not contain an arbitration provision before an agreement containing an arbitration provision will be held unconscionable on the basis that the party had no meaningful choice.</s></p>

<p n="21"><s n="77" type="analysis">The Leemans were not denied the opportunity to "shop around" in this case. </s><s n="78" type="analysis">In light of their undisputed failure even to attempt to do so, we cannot conclude that they lacked a meaningful choice in assenting to the termite agreement.</s></p>

<p n="22"><s n="79" type="issue">The Leemans also maintain that the termite agreement was a contract of adhesion and that they had no input in its drafting and could not negotiate its terms. </s><s n="80" type="issue">Thus, they argue, under Anderson, supra, Cook's Pest Control is deemed to have had overwhelming bargaining power. </s><s n="81" type="fact">As support for their argument, the Leemans produced responses to interrogatories in which Cook's Pest Control answered that, in an attempt to maintain uniformity, it did not negotiate the terms of its contracts and, as a "general rule," did not negotiate the removal of the arbitration provision.</s></p>

<p n="23"><s n="82" type="fact">First, it is undisputed that the Leemans did not attempt to negotiate any of the terms of the termite agreement. </s><s n="83" type="fact">There is no evidence in the record indicating that the Leemans attempted to contact Cook's Pest Control before the closing to negotiate the terms of the termite agreement, and it is undisputed that they did not attempt to renegotiate the termite agreement after the closing or at the time the agreement was renewed. </s><s n="84" type="procedure">Instead, the Leemans raised their first objection to the arbitration provision after litigation in this case began.</s></p>

    <p n="24"><s n="85" type="analysis">In Anderson, a majority of this Court held that the plaintiffs in that case had demonstrated that the defendant had overwhelming bargaining power by presenting sufficient evidence (1) that the plaintiffs could not have acquired similar services in their geographic area without assenting to an arbitration provision; (2) that the plaintiffs were unsophisticated, uneducated, and illiterate; (3) that one of the defendants had misrepresented to the plaintiffs the existence of the arbitration provision; and (4) that the plaintiffs had no input in negotiating any of the terms of the contract. </s><lawcit>Anderson, 873 So.2d at 169, 177–79. </lawcit><s n="86" type="analysis">In this case, the Leemans have failed to demonstrate that they could not have obtained from another pest-control provider a termite-control agreement that did not contain an arbitration provision; the Leemans are not unsophisticated, uneducated, or illiterate; and there is certainly no evidence indicating that they assented to an arbitration provision based on misrepresentations by Cook's Pest Control. </s><s n="87" type="analysis">Therefore, Anderson is distinguishable.</s></p>
