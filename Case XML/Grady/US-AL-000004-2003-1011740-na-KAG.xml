<div><p><s n="1">Michael J. Anderson, American General Finance, Inc., and Merit Life Insurance Company appeal from an order denying their motions to compel arbitration in an action filed against them in the Limestone Circuit Court by Mary Jean Ashby. </s><s n="2">We affirm.</s></p></div>

<div><head>Background</head></div>

<div><p><s n="3">On April 15, 1999, Mary Jean Ashby and Jimmy Ashby, her now-deceased husband, visited the American General Finance office located in Athens, Alabama, to obtain a $2,000 loan to be secured by their automobile. </s><s n="4" type="fact">The loan was to be paid over a period of three years. </s><s n="5">Mr. Ashby indicated on the loan application that his only source of income was "disability" and "soc. sec."; Mrs. Ashby indicated on the loan application that her only source of income was "disability." </s><s n="6">According to Mrs. Ashby, Mr. Ashby wanted to obtain credit-life insurance so that she would not have to worry about the payments on the loan in the event something happened to him. </s><s n="7">It is undisputed that Mr. Ashby agreed to pay $827.10 in order to purchase $5,000 of credit-life insurance during the term of their three-year note.</s></p>

<p><s n="8">While at American General Finance's office, the Ashbys met with Michael Anderson, the branch manager for American General Finance; Anderson is also an insurance agent for Merit Life Insurance Company, an affiliate of American General Finance. </s><s n="9">Mr. Anderson acknowledges that, as a result of doing business with the Ashbys, he knew that Mr. Ashby was unable to read and write and that he could not sign his own name. </s><s n="10">Anderson also admits that he knew Mrs. Ashby was limited in her reading ability.</s></p>

<p><s n="11">Mrs. Ashby claims that she and Mr. Ashby asked Anderson to explain the loan documents because they were unable to read and understand the documents. </s><s n="12">Additionally, the operating procedures of American General Finance applicable to customers who are blind or who cannot read require the company's representative to explain the documents to the customer before obtaining the customer's signature.</s></p>

<p><s n="13">Anderson alleges that he explained the loan and credit-life insurance documents to the Ashbys. </s><s n="14">Anderson claims that, in accordance with American General Finance's operating procedures applicable to illiterate customers, he wrote at the bottom of each document involved in the loan transaction "THIS DOCUMENT EXPLAINED AND UNDERSTOOD BY THE BORROWER." </s><s n="15">According to Anderson, he then had the Ashbys sign the documents. Mrs. Ashby denies that the documents she executed bore any handwritten statements when she signed them.</s></p>

<p><s n="16">The note and security agreement executed by the Ashbys on April 15, 1999, contained an arbitration agreement, which included the following provisions:</s></p>

<p><s n="17">"ARBITRATION OF CLAIMS AND WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL:</s></p>

<p><s n="18">"Borrower(s) hereby acknowledge that the transactions evidenced by this agreement involve interstate commerce. </s><s n="19">Borrower(s) and Lender agree that, except as otherwise set forth in this provision, all claims, disputes, or controversies of every kind and nature between Borrower(s) and Lender shall be resolved by arbitration including (i) those based on contract, tort or statute, (ii) those arising out of or relating to the transaction(s) evidenced by this agreement, the disclosures relating to this agreement, the Federal Disclosure Statement, any insurance certificates or policies, any documents executed at or about the same time this agreement was executed or (iii) those arising out of, [or] relating to any other prior, proposed or actual loan or extension of credit (and the relationships which result from these transactions or any other previous transactions between Borrower(s) and Lender). </s><s n="20">Borrower(s) and Lender further agree that all issues and disputes as to the arbitrability of claims must also be resolved by the arbitrator.</s></p>

<p><s n="21">"BORROWER(S) AND LENDER UNDERSTAND THAT EACH HAS THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE SUCH DISPUTES THROUGH A COURT, AND BORROWER(S) AND LENDER VOLUNTARILY AND KNOWINGLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT THEY HAVE TO A JURY TRIAL OR JUDGE TRIAL OF SUCH DISPUTES.</s></p>

<p><s n="22">"....</s></p>

<p><s n="23">"BORROWER(S) AND LENDER AGREE THAT THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD PUNITIVE DAMAGES ONLY UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE A COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION COULD AWARD SUCH DAMAGES. </s><s n="24">HOWEVER, IN NO EVENT SHALL AN AWARD OF DAMAGES EXCEED FIVE (5) TIMES THE ECONOMIC LOSS SUFFERED BY THE PARTY. </s><s n="25">BORROWER(S) AND LENDER FURTHER AGREE THAT THE ARBITRATOR SHALL NOT CONDUCT ANY CLASS-WIDE PROCEEDINGS AND WILL BE RESTRICTED TO RESOLVING THE INDIVIDUAL DISPUTES BETWEEN THE PARTIES.</s></p>

<p><s n="26">"Borrower(s) and Lender agree that, notwithstanding the foregoing, Lender retains the right to use judicial or self-help remedies (i) to repossess or foreclose on collateral or to enforce the security interests relating to this transaction, and (ii) to pursue collection actions against the Borrower(s) where the amount of the debt is $10,000 or less. </s><s n="27">The exercise of this right by Lender to pursue judicial or self-help remedies shall not constitute a waiver of Lender's right to compel the arbitration of any claim or dispute subject to this arbitration clause-including the filing of a counterclaim by Borrower(s) in a lawsuit filed by Lender.</s></p>

<p><s n="28">"This arbitration clause shall be binding upon the assigns, directors, officers, representatives, employees, parent companies, affiliate companies, subsidiaries and successors of lender, and the administrators, assigns, executors, heirs and representatives of Borrower(s). </s><s n="29">In addition, the parties agree to submit to arbitration not only the foregoing claims or disputes against each other, but also all claims or disputes they have against (i) all other persons or entities involved with the transactions subject to this clause, (ii) all persons or entities who signed or executed any of the documentation subject to this clause, and (iii) all persons or entities who may be jointly or severally liable to any of the parties to this agreement regarding matters or events relating to the transactions and documentation subject to this clause.</s></p>

<p><s n="30">"Borrower(s) and Lender agree that if any provision of this arbitration clause is invalid or unenforceable under the Federal Arbitration Act, the provision which is found to be invalid or unenforceable shall be inapplicable and deemed omitted, but shall not invalidate the remaining provisions of this arbitration clause, and shall not diminish the parties' obligation to arbitrate the disputes subject to this clause." </s><s n="31">(Capitalization in original.)</s></p> 
    
<p><s n="32">Above the signature line on the note and security agreement is written "THIS DOCUMENT EXPLAINED AND UNDERSTOOD BY THE BORROWER"; on the signature line is an "X," presumably Jimmy Ashby's mark, and Mrs. Ashby's signature.</s></p>

<p><s n="33">Included with the application for credit-life insurance submitted to Merit Life Insurance by Jimmy Ashby on April 15, 1999, was a separate, stand-alone document, on which was printed another arbitration agreement.</s><s n="34">That arbitration agreement provided, in pertinent part:</s></p>

<p><s n="35">"ARBITRATION OF CLAIMS AND WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL</s></p>

<p><s n="36">"Merit Life Insurance Co. and I hereby acknowledge that the transactions covered by the Policy being applied for involve interstate commerce. </s><s n="37">We agree that all claims, disputes, or controversies of every kind and nature between us shall be resolved by arbitration including (i) those based on contract, tort, or statute, (ii) those arising out of or relating to the transaction(s) evidenced by a policy, the disclosures relating to a policy, any documents executed at or about the same time a policy was executed or (iii) the relationships which result from these transactions or any other previous transactions between us. </s><s n="38">Merit Life Insurance Co. and I further agree that all issues and disputes as to the arbitrability of claims must also be resolved by the arbitrator.</s></p>

<p><s n="39">"WE UNDERSTAND THAT EACH HAS THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE SUCH DISPUTES THROUGH A COURT, AND WE VOLUNTARILY AND KNOWINGLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT WE HAVE TO A JURY TRIAL OR JUDGE TRIAL OF SUCH DISPUTES.</s></p>

MERIT LIFE INSURANCE CO. AND I FURTHER AGREE THAT THE ARBITRATOR SHALL NOT CONDUCT ANY CLASS-WIDE PROCEEDINGS AND WILL BE RESTRICTED TO RESOLVING THE INDIVIDUAL DISPUTES BETWEEN THE PARTIES.</s></p>

<p><s n="43">"This arbitration clause shall be binding upon the assigns, directors, officers, representatives, employees, agents, parent companies, affiliated companies, subsidiaries and successors of Merit Life Insurance Co. and my administrators, assigns, executors, heirs and representatives. </s><s n="44">In addition, the parties agree to submit to arbitration not only the foregoing claims or disputes against each other, but also all claims or disputes they have against (i) all other persons or entities involved with the transactions subject to this clause, (ii) all persons or entities who signed or executed any of the documentation subject to this clause, and (iii) all persons or entities who may be jointly or severally liable to any of the parties to this agreement regarding matters or events relating to the transactions and documentation subject to this clause.</s></p>

<p><s n="45">"Merit Life Insurance Co. and I agree that if any provision of this arbitration clause is invalid or unenforceable under the Federal Arbitration Act, the provision which is found to be invalid or unenforceable shall be inapplicable and deemed omitted, but shall not invalidate the remaining provisions of this arbitration clause, and shall not diminish the parties' obligation to arbitrate the disputes subject to this clause." </s><s n="46">(Capitalization in original.)</s></p>

<p><s n="47">Above the signature line on this arbitration agreement was written "THIS DOCUMENT EXPLAINED AND UNDERSTOOD BY APPLICANT"; an "X," presumably Jimmy Ashby's mark, is shown on the signature line.</s></p>

<p><s n="48">Although Anderson admits that he never received any training from American General Finance on how to explain an arbitration agreement to customers, he says that he explained the arbitration agreements to the Ashbys. </s><s n="49">Mrs. Ashby claims that Anderson never explained or mentioned to them the arbitration agreements contained in the loan and credit-life insurance documents. </s><s n="50">She also claims that she was within hearing distance of Mr. Ashby and Anderson during the entire closing and that Anderson never explained or mentioned arbitration to Mr. Ashby in connection with the credit-life insurance documents.</s></p>

<p><s n="51">On December 2, 1999, Mr. Ashby died. Mrs. Ashby filed a claim for the death benefit provided under the credit-life insurance policy Mr. Ashby had obtained from Merit Life. </s><s n="52">Merit Life did not pay the claim; instead, it rescinded the policy issued to Mr. Ashby. </s><s n="53">Merit Life alleged that Mr. Ashby had answered the questions on the insurance application regarding his health inaccurately. </s><s n="54">Mrs. Ashby alleges that Anderson, who read the questions to them, never asked them any questions about Mr. Ashby's health.</s></p>

<p><s n="55">On April 17, 2000, Mary Jean Ashby filed this action in the Limestone Circuit Court, as the personal representative of the estate of her deceased husband Jimmy Ashby, and in her individual capacity. </s><s n="56">Mrs. Ashby seeks compensatory and punitive damages as a result of Merit Life's refusal to pay benefits under the credit-life insurance policy issued in connection with the American General Finance loan.</s></p>

<p><s n="57">Anderson, American General Finance, and Merit Life each moved to stay the proceedings and to compel arbitration, relying upon the arbitration agreements contained in the note and security agreement and executed as part of the application for credit-life insurance. </s><s n="58">Mrs. Ashby opposed those motions to compel, asserting that the arbitration agreements were unconscionable and that they were obtained through fraud.</s></p>

<p><s n="59">On January 22, 2002, after receiving briefs and conducting hearings, the trial court denied the motions to compel arbitration on the grounds that the arbitration agreement contained in the note and security agreement was unconscionable and that "fraud in the factum" had occurred with regard to the arbitration agreement executed in connection with the application for credit-life insurance. </s><s n="60">On February 20, 2002, Anderson, American General Finance, and Merit Life moved, pursuant to Rule </s><lawcit>59(e), Ala. R. Civ. P., </lawcit><s n="61">to alter, amend, or vacate the trial court's order. On May 8, 2002, the trial court denied the defendants' Rule 59(e) motion.</s></p>

<p><s n="62">American General Finance, Anderson, and Merit Life appeal, asserting the following claims: that the trial court erred and usurped the arbitrator's authority by deciding the threshold issues of arbitrability; that the trial court erred in concluding that the arbitration agreement included in the note and security agreement was unconscionable; and that the trial court erred in concluding that Mr. Ashby's fraud claim presented a question for the jury.</s></p></div>

<div><head>Standard of Review</head></div>

<div><p><s n="63">In American General Finance, Inc. v. Morton, </s><lawcit>812 So.2d 282 (Ala.2001), </lawcit><s n="64">this Court recited the now familiar standard of review applicable to motions to compel arbitration:</s></p>

<p><s n="65">"This Court reviews the [grant or] denial of a motion to compel arbitration de novo. </s><lawcit>Green Tree Fin. Corp. v. Vintson, 753 So.2d 497, 502 (Ala.1999); Patrick Home Ctr., Inc. v. Karr, 730 So.2d 1171, 1172 (Ala.1999). </lawcit><s n="66">The party seeking to compel arbitration has the initial burden of proving the existence of a contract calling for arbitration and proving that the contract evidences a transaction substantially affecting interstate commerce. </s><lawcit>TranSouth Fin.

<div><head>Analysis</head></div>

<div><head>I. Did the trial court err and usurp the arbitrator's authority in deciding the threshold issue of arbitrability?</head></div>

<div><p><s n="69">The trial court determined that the arbitration agreement included in the note and security agreement was unconscionable and therefore unenforceable. </s><s n="70">American General Finance and Anderson appeal, arguing that whether the arbitration agreement was unenforceable was an issue for the arbitrator to decide rather than for the trial court. </s><s n="71">We disagree.</s></p>

<p><s n="72">The Federal Arbitration Act, </s><lawcit>9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq. (the "FAA"), </lawcit><s n="73">"binds us to faithfully apply general principles of Alabama contract law when considering a challenge to the validity of an arbitration agreement." </s><lawcit>Green Tree Fin. Corp. v. Wampler, 749 So.2d 409, 416 (Ala.1999). </lawcit><s n="74">As Justice Lyons noted in his concurring opinion in Ex parte Dan Tucker Auto Sales, Inc., </s><lawcit>718 So.2d 33 (Ala.1998):</lawcit></p>

<p><s n="75">"Alabama has long recognized the doctrine of unconscionability as a defense to enforcement of a contract. </s><s n="76">While Prima Paint Corp. v. Flood &amp; Conklin Mfg. Co., </s><lawcit>388 U.S. 395, 87 S.Ct. 1801, 18 L.Ed.2d 1270 (1967), </lawcit><s n="77">relegates challenges to the validity of a contract as a whole to the arbitrator, a challenge to the arbitration clause only is properly determined by the court." </s><lawcit>718 So.2d at 43 (Lyons, J., concurring specially) (citation omitted).</lawcit></p>
    
<p><s n="78">This Court reached the same conclusion in American General Finance, Inc. v. Branch, </s><lawcit>793 So.2d 738 (Ala.2000), </lawcit><s n="79">a case almost identical to this one. </s><s n="80">In Branch, this Court rejected an argument identical to the one raised by American General Finance and Anderson in this case: that because the parties had agreed that issues of arbitrability were to be decided by the arbitrator, the trial court had no authority to address the issue of unconscionability. </s><s n="81">The Branch Court stated:</s></p>

<p><s n="82">" '[A] determination that, by the terms of the arbitration clause, the arbitrator is to decide issues of arbitrability, does not end the inquiry.' </s><s n="83">'Where the attack is addressed to the arbitration clause itself, as opposed to the contract as a whole, the court, and not the arbitrator, resolves the issue.' </s><s n="84">Thus, the threshold 'issue of unconscionability of an arbitration clause is a question for the court and not the arbitrator.' " </s><lawcit>793 So.2d at 748 (quoting Green Tree Fin. Corp. v. Wampler, 749 So.2d 409, 413, 415 (Ala.1999), and citing Ex parte Napier, 723 So.2d 49 (Ala.1998)); Ex parte Dan Tucker Auto Sales, Inc., 718 So.2d at 41 (Lyons, J., concurring specially).</lawcit></p>

<p><s n="85">We agree with Branch and the cases cited in that opinion. </s><s n="86">Because Mrs. Ashby contends that the arbitration agreement included in the note and security agreement was itself unconscionable, the trial court did not err in holding that it had the authority to resolve that issue.</s></p></div>


<div><head>II. Did the trial court err in ruling that the arbitration agreement included in the note and security agreement was unconscionable as a matter of law?</head></div>

<div><p><s n="87">American General Finance and Anderson argue that the trial court erred in concluding that the arbitration agreement included in the note and security agreement was unconscionable as a matter of law. </s><s n="88">In reaching that conclusion, the trial court relied heavily upon Branch, which it summarized in its order. </s><s n="89">In pertinent part, the trial court's order provided:</s></p>

<p><s n="90">"The defense of unconscionability must be addressed by the trial court. </s><lawcit>Green Tree Financial Corp. v. Vintson, 753 So.2d 497 (Ala.1999). </lawcit><s n="91">The party asserting the affirmative defense of unconscionability has the burden of proof. </s><lawcit>Green Tree Fin. Corp. v. Wampler, 749 So.2d 409 (Ala.1999). </lawcit><s n="92">The doctrine of unconscionability is codified at </s><lawcit>[Ala.Code 1975, § 5-19-16], </lawcit><s n="93">which provides:</s></p>

<p><s n="94">" 'With respect to a consumer credit transaction, if the court as a matter of law finds the contract or any provision of the contract to have been unconscionable at the time it was made, the court may refuse to enforce the contract, or it may enforce the remainder of the contract without the unconscionable provision, or it may so limit the application of any unconscionable provision so as to avoid any unconscionable result.'</s></p>

<p><s n="95">"The Alabama Supreme Court set forth a two-part test to be applied by this court in determining unconscionability: (1) Terms that are grossly favorable to a party that has (2) overwhelming bargaining power. </s><lawcit>American General Finance, Inc. v. Branch, 793 So.2d 738, 748 (Ala.2000). </lawcit><s n="96">The court notes that the arbitration clause in the note and security agreement supplied by [American General Finance] in this case is identical to that supplied by [American General Finance] in Branch. </s><s n="97">The Alabama Supreme Court affirmed the trial court's denial of [American General Finance's] Motion to Compel Arbitration in Branch because it found the arbitration clause unconscionable.</s></p>

<p><s n="98">"The same grossly favorable terms favoring [American General Finance] that existed in Branch are present here. </s><s n="99">The first indicium of unconscionability is the breadth of the clause. </s><s n="100">The Branch court stated that the clause applied 'to every cause of action that could conceivably arise in favor of Branch, and to every individual against whom a claim could conceivably be brought.' </s><lawcit>Id.</lawcit></p>

<p><s n="101">"A second indicium of unconscionability is the provision purporting to invest the arbitrator with the threshold issues of arbitrability. </s><s n="102">The Branch court stated that ' "[s]uch authority of the arbitrator to determine its own authority may itself be an indicium of unconscionability." ' </s><lawcit>Id. at 749, quoting Brilliant Homes, Ltd. v. Lind, 722 So.2d 753, 755 (Ala.1998).</lawcit></p>

<p><s n="103">"A third indicium of unconscionability is the provision exempting the defendants from the duty to arbitrate and expressly reserving the right to try to a jury their claims against the Ashbys up to $10,000. </s><s n="104">In Branch, the Alabama Supreme Court stated:</s></p>

<p><s n="105">" 'Practically speaking, this provision benefits only the [l]enders. In other words, American General [Finance] reserved for itself the right to collect by judicial action the loan payments-the only species of claim it would ever realistically be expected to assert against Branch-while requiring Branch to settle by arbitration claims such as breach of contract and fraud-the species of claims she would most likely assert against the [l]enders.' </s><s n="106">(emphasis in original). </s><lawcit>[793 So.2d at 749.]</lawcit></p>

<p><s n="107">"The [American General Finance] arbitration provision limits the right of the arbitrator to award an amount in excess of five times the amount of economic loss. </s><s n="108">The Branch court stated 'this limitation includes not only punitive damages, but all species of noneconomic loss, such as mental anguish.' </s><lawcit>[793 So.2d at 749.] </lawcit><s n="109">The Branch court found it significant that the arbitration clause prevented the borrower from obtaining the full range of relief available under Alabama law, but allowed the lenders to seek full redress for their claims in court. </s><lawcit>Id.</lawcit></p>

<p><s n="110">"The Branch court found that the [American General Finance] arbitration provisions were so grossly favorable to the defendants as to pass the first prong of the unconscionability test. </s><lawcit>Id. at 750. </lawcit><s n="111">Along with each grossly favorable term constituting an indicium of unconscionability found in the Branch case, this court finds an additional indicium of unconscionability. </s><s n="112">The Ashbys requested that the defendants explain the terms of the contract to them. The defendant's agent chose not to explain, or even mention, the arbitration clause. </s><s n="113">Such a refusal of assistance is an indicium of unconscionability. </s><lawcit>Ex parte Napier, 723 So.2d 49, 52 (Ala.1998).</lawcit></p>

<p><s n="114">"The second prong of the unconscionability test set forth in Branch is overwhelming bargaining power. </s><lawcit>American General Finance, Inc. v.

<p><s n="120">"In the case at hand, the record reveals that ten companies advertised under the heading 'financing' in the Athens BellSouth Yellow Pages at the time that the Ashbys applied for their loan. </s><s n="121">The parties presented evidence from nine of those ten companies. </s><s n="121">Of those nine companies, three (Badcock Home Furnishing Center, First South Production Credit Association and First Trust Mortgage of Athens) did not routinely make loans to consumers using personal property as collateral-the type of loan at issue. </s><s n="122">All of the six remaining companies, including [American General Finance], required arbitration agreements of their customers. </s><s n="123">The record further reveals that the defendants presented affidavits from four banks and financial institutions that did not require arbitration agreements that maintained an office in Athens, Alabama, but [that] were not listed under 'financing' in the Yellow Pages. </s><s n="124">The evidence also reveals that the Ashbys presented evidence of four such additional institutions that did require arbitration agreements. </s><s n="125">The defendants presented affidavits from companies that did not require arbitration agreements in cities other than Athens.</s></p>

<div><p><s n="131">As the trial court noted, the arbitration agreement included in the note and security agreement is identical to the arbitration agreement this Court found unconscionable in Branch. </s><s n="132">Thus, each of the provisions of the Branch arbitration agreement found to be grossly favorable to the lenders is also present in the Ashbys' arbitration agreement with American General Finance. </s><s n="133">Those provisions grossly favorable to American General Finance are: (1) the breadth of the arbitration agreement, which extends to every cause of action that might conceivably arise in favor of the Ashbys and that applies to every individual or entity against whom the Ashbys might bring a claim; (2) the provision purporting to invest the arbitrator with the threshold issue of arbitrability; (3) the provision reserving to American General Finance the right to a trial by jury while mandating that the Ashbys arbitrate any and every claim that might arise; and (4) the provision limiting the Ashbys' right of recovery for all species of damages to no more than five times the economic loss while preserving American General Finance's right to seek full redress for its claims.</s></p>

<p><s n="134">We agree with the trial court that the arbitration agreement contained in the note and security agreement is grossly favorable to American General Finance. </s><s n="135">Accordingly, Mrs. Ashby has met the first prong of the Branch unconscionability test.</s></p></div>

<div><head>The Second Prong of Branch-Overwhelming Bargaining Power</head></div>

<div><p><s n="136">American General Finance and Anderson argue that the trial court erred in finding the arbitration agreement unconscionable because, they argue, Mrs. Ashby failed to meet the second prong of the Branch unconscionability test. </s><s n="137">American General Finance and Anderson argue that the trial court ignored evidence presented indicating that there were lenders in the financial market available to the Ashbys that would make loans without requiring an arbitration agreement and that ignoring that evidence caused the trial court to err in concluding that the Ashbys had no meaningful choice and could not obtain an arbitration-free loan. </s><s n="138">Further, American General Finance and Anderson argue that Mrs. Ashby cannot meet the second prong of the Branch test because, they say, she failed to present any evidence indicating that she and Mr. Ashby actually shopped around for an arbitration-free loan. </s><s n="139">We reject these arguments.</s></p>


<p><s n="140">First, we note that the trial court limited the financial market it considered to be available to the Ashbys to those lenders advertising in the yellow pages of the Athens BellSouth telephone directory under "financing" at the time the Ashbys applied with American General Finance for their loan in April 1999.</s><s n="141">This is exactly the type of comparison this Court made in Branch, and we find no error in this method of determining the applicable market available to the Ashbys. </s><lawcit>See Branch, 793 So.2d at 751 (considering the appropriate comparable financial market to be composed of those entities listed in the advertising pages of the Southern Directory Company telephone directory for the city nearest the plaintiff).</lawcit></p>

<p><s n="142">Moreover, the trial court did not err in concluding that the arbitration agreement in the note and security agreement was unconscionable in the absence of evidence indicating that the Ashbys sought other alternatives to the American General Finance loan. </s><s n="143">Our decision in Branch regarding meaningful choice was based upon affidavits and stipulations regarding the practices of nearby lenders that were in the business of making loans comparable to the one Branch sought to obtain. </s><s n="144">In Branch, we stated:</s></p>

<p><s n="145">"From the sample responses of the companies providing the kind of financing for which Branch was shopping in her geographical area, it follows that only 1 or 2 companies out of 16 might have allowed her to borrow money in November 1997 without agreeing to arbitrate. </s><s n="146">Branch would have had to expend considerable time and effort even to find these companies." </s><lawcit>793 So.2d at 751 (first emphasis added; second emphasis in original).</lawcit></p> 

<p><s n="147">Thus, our holding in Branch was not based upon evidence showing that Branch had actually gone out and traveled a particular geographical area of the state in an unsuccessful attempt to obtain a loan free from the restriction of an arbitration clause. </s><s n="148">We concluded that American General Finance possessed overwhelming bargaining power because "Branch would have had to expend considerable effort even to find " the 1 or 2 of the 16 companies that would not have required arbitration. </s><lawcit>793 So.2d at 751.</lawcit></p>

<p><s n="149">In this case, Mrs. Ashby presented the same type of evidence we considered in Branch. </s><s n="150">Mrs. Ashby presented the trial court with evidence indicating that, at the time she and Mr. Ashby obtained their loan with American General Finance in 1999, 10 companies, including American General Finance, advertised in the yellow pages of the Athens BellSouth telephone directory under the category "financing." </s><s n="151">Mrs. Ashby presented evidence indicating that 2 of those 10 companies did not make loans of the type sought by the Ashbys,</s><s n="152">while 6 companies, including American General Finance, did make loans comparable to the one sought by the Ashbys.</s> <s n="153">Mrs. Ashby presented evidence indicating that all six of those companies required their customers to sign arbitration agreements. </s><s n="154">Thus, we conclude, as we did in Branch, that the Ashbys would have had to expend considerable time and effort to locate the remaining two companies, and it is unknown whether those companies would have insisted that the Ashbys sign an arbitration agreement.</s></p>

<p><s n="155">Justice Stuart, in her special writing, states that she would require evidence showing that the plaintiff actually shopped around for an arbitration-free loan. </s><s n="156">She relies upon the recent cases of Mason v. Acceptance Loan Co., </s><lawcit>850 So.2d 289 (Ala.2002); Vann v. First Community Credit Corp., 834 So.2d 751 (Ala.2002); and Green Tree Fin. Corp. v. Lewis, 813 So.2d 820 (Ala.2001). </lawcit><s n="157">Her writing prompts additional observations.</s></p>

<p><s n="158">Anderson, the corporate defendants' agent and himself a defendant, admits that he knew that the Ashbys could not read the documents he presented to them. </s><s n="159">The "operating procedures" of American General Finance itself therefore required Anderson to explain those documents to the Ashbys, and Anderson did in fact undertake and purport to explain the documents to the Ashbys. </s><s n="160">These facts are undisputed. </s><s n="161">Mrs. Ashby, further, has submitted evidence indicating that she and Mr. Ashby requested an explanation of the documents and that Anderson withheld from the explanation he gave any mention of the presence or the effect of any "arbitration agreement."</s></p>

<p><s n="162">Mason, on which Justice Stuart relies in her special writing, cites Mitchell Nissan, Inc. v. Foster, </s><lawcit>775 So.2d 138, 140 (Ala.2000), </lawcit><s n="163">for the proposition that "an illiterate person, 'if he neglects to have [a document he signs] read, or to [i]nquire as to its contents,' cannot, 'in the absence of fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation, avoid the effect of his signature because [he is] not informed of its contents.' " </s><lawcit>(Quoting Beck &amp; Pauli Lithographing Co. v. Houppert &amp; Worcester, 104 Ala. 503, 506, 16 So. 522, 522 (1894).) </lawcit><s n="164">Mrs. Ashby's evidence fulfills both exceptions to the binding effect of their signatures. </s><s n="165">First, they did "[i]nquire as to ...

<p><s n="168">Neither Vann nor Lewis constitutes a retreat from Branch. </s><s n="169">Each turns on the utter failure of the plaintiffs to submit evidence of the scarcity of lenders that did not require arbitration agreements in the particular market in which the plaintiffs were seeking loans. </s><lawcit>Vann, 834 So.2d at 754, and Lewis, 813 So.2d at 825. </lawcit><s n="170">Mrs. Ashby, like the plaintiff in Branch, did submit such evidence.</s></p>

<p><s n="171">Finally, the facts of this case do not logically present an issue whether the Ashbys should have "actually shopped around" for a lender that would not require that they execute an arbitration agreement. </s><s n="172">The Ashbys' inability to read the documents and agent Anderson's alleged failure to mention the "arbitration agreement" when he undertook and purported to explain the documents to them deprived the Ashbys of any reason to "shop around" for such a lender.</s></p>

    <p><s n="173">The trial court also determined, and we agree, that the Ashbys had no input into negotiating the terms of or drafting the arbitration agreement. </s><s n="174">This evidence establishes that the Ashbys had no meaningful choice in accepting the arbitration agreement and that American General Finance had overwhelming bargaining power in obtaining the arbitration agreement.</s><s n="175">For these reasons, we find that the evidence is sufficient to meet the second prong of the Branch unconscionability test.</s></p></div>

<div><head>Severability Provision</head></div>

<div><p><s n="176">American General Finance and Anderson next argue that, even assuming that the trial court properly concluded that the arbitration agreement included in the note and security agreement contains some unconscionable provisions, the trial court erred by not striking only those provisions it found to be unconscionable while enforcing the remainder of the arbitration agreement, pursuant to the severability clause included in that arbitration agreement. </s><s n="177">American General Finance and Anderson rely upon Cavalier Mfg., Inc. v. Jackson, </s><lawcit>823 So.2d 1237 (Ala.2001), overruled on other grounds, Ex parte Thicklin, 824 So.2d 723 (Ala.2002); </lawcit><s n="178">and on Ex parte Thicklin, supra, as authority for their argument.</s></p>

<p><s n="179">In Cavalier Manufacturing and Ex parte Thicklin this Court struck only the offensive provisions of the arbitration agreements under consideration in those cases and upheld the remainder of those agreements. </s><s n="180">However, the arbitration agreements considered in those cases contained only one unconscionable provision; the arbitration agreement in this case is  unconscionable in numerous aspects. </s><s n="181">For this reason alone, Cavalier Manufacturing and Ex parte Thicklin are distinguishable.</s></p>

<p><s n="182">Additionally, in Ex parte Thicklin, this Court expressly recognized:</s></p>
    
<p><s n="183">"This Court has limited authority to deal with the enforceability of contract terms. </s><s n="184">It can nullify or reform a contract on the basis of fraud; it can also nullify or reform a contract to eliminate any unconscionable provisions or terms that violate public policy." </s><lawcit>824 So.2d at 732 (citing in a footnote Ex parte State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co., 764 So.2d 543, 546 (Ala.2000) (Lyons, J., concurring specially)). See also § 5-19-16, Ala.Code 1975, </lawcit><s n="185">which states, in pertinent part:</s></p>

<p><s n="186">"With respect to a consumer credit transaction, if the court as a matter of law finds the contract or any provision of the contract to have been unconscionable at the time it was made, the court may refuse to enforce the contract, or it may enforce the remainder of the contract without the unconscionable provision, or it may so limit the application of any unconscionable provision so as to avoid any unconscionable result."</s></p>

<p><s n="187">We conclude that the arbitration agreement included in American General Finance's note and security agreement meets the two-part test for unconscionability set forth in Branch. </s><s n="188">The entire arbitration agreement is unconscionable and therefore unenforceable. </s><s n="189">We affirm the trial court's order denying the motion to compel the Ashbys' claims against American General Finance and Anderson to arbitrate under that agreement.</s></p></div>

<div><head>III. Did the trial court err in concluding that Mr. Ashby's fraud claim presented a question for the jury?</head></div>
            
<div><p><s n="190">Mrs. Ashby alleges that the arbitration agreement executed in connection with the Merit Life application for credit-life insurance was obtained by fraud.</s><s n="191">The trial court concluded that Mrs. Ashby presented substantial evidence of fraud in the factum and, therefore, that her claims must be resolved by a jury. </s><s n="192">Merit Life appeals. </s><s n="193">We affirm.</s></p>

<p><s n="194">Whether we view Mrs. Ashby's fraud claim as one of fraudulent inducement or as one of fraud in the factum, we conclude that the claim presents a jury question.</s></p>

<p><s n="195">If we construe the claim as alleging that Mr. Ashby was fraudulently induced into signing the arbitration agreement presented in conjunction with Merit Life's credit-life insurance application, that claim is not subject to arbitration because it is directed at the arbitration agreement itself.</s><s n="196">In Investment Management &amp; Research, Inc. v.
