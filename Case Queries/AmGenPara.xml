<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">American General Finance, Inc. (“American General”); Merit Life Insurance Co. (“Merit”); and Yosemite Insurance Company (“Yosemite”) (collectively “the Lenders”) appeal from an order denying their motions to compel the arbitration of claims presented in an action commenced by Mable Branch (appeal no. 1990887) and an order denying their motions to compel the arbitration of claims presented in an action commenced by April Reaves (appeal no. 1990888). We affirm as to case 1990887, but as to case 1990888 we reverse and remand.</p>
<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The claims of Branch and Reaves arose out of a series of loan transactions in which they separately borrowed money from American General. In Reaves’s case, the first transaction occurred in December 1994, and the second on November 2, 1995. In Branch’s case, the first transaction occurred on July 3, 1996; a second on October 18, 1996; and a third on November 21, 1997.</p>
<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The “Note and Security Agreement” signed by Branch on November 21, 1997, contained the following pertinent provisions:</p>
<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">(Boldface type and capitalization in original.)</p>
<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The “Note and Security Agreement” executed by Reaves on November 2, 1995, contained arbitration provisions that differed from the ones in Branch’s contract in only one material respect. That agreement did not contain the provision purporting to make arbitrable “all issues and disputes as to the arbitrability of claims." (Boldface type omitted.)</p>
<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Branch and Reaves commenced their actions on June 15, 1998, and September 11, 1998, respectively. Branch sued Merit and Yosemite, as well as American General, while Reaves sued only American General. Broadly stated, the substantive allegations common to both complaints were that the plaintiffs were enticed, pursuant to a scheme or plan, to borrow money under circumstances that enabled the defendants (1) to collect excessive finance charges; (2) to sell customers “duplicative services” through “flipping”1; and (3) to collect unnecessary or excessive premiums for credit-disability insurance and life insurance.</p>
<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">*742 All defendants moved to compel arbitration of the actions, based on the arbitration provisions in the “Note and Security Agreement” documents. In a written order, the trial court denied the motions on the ground that the arbitration provisions were unconscionable. The order stated in pertinent part:</p>
<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The intention of this section is to allow the courts to pass directly on the unconscionability of the contract or the particular clause therein and to make a determination as to its unconscionability. Id. It is within the court’s discretion to refuse to enforce the contract as a whole if it is permeated by unconscionability, or to strike any single clause or group of clauses that are so tainted or that are contrary to the essential purpose of the agreement, or to simply limit the unconscionable clause so as to avoid unconscionable results.’</p>
<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">540 So.2d at 716. See also Williams v. E.F. Hutton Mortgage Corp., 555 So.2d 158 (Ala.1989); Crestline Ctr. v. Hinton, 567 So.2d 393 (Ala.Civ.App.1990); Marshall v. Mercury Fin. Co., 550 So.2d 1026 (Ala.Civ.App.1989); Advertiser Co. v. Electronic Eng’rs, Inc., 527 So.2d 1317 (Ala.Civ.App.1988).</p>
<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">(Emphasis added except where noted.)</p>
<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">From this order, the defendants appeal. The appeals present these issues: (1) whether the FAA applies to the contracts; (2) whether a contract may remove from the judiciary the right to decide the threshold issue of unconscionability; and (3) whether, under these facts, the arbitration provision in either contract, or both contracts, is unconscionable.</p>
<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">[1] [2] The FAA applies only (1) if there is a “written agreement calling for arbitration,” Prudential Sec., Inc. v. Micro–Fab, Inc., 689 So.2d 829, 832 (Ala.1997)"; and (2) if the contract containing the arbitration provision “substantially affects interstate commerce.” Sisters of the Visitation v. Cochran Plastering Co., 775 So.2d 759, 766 (Ala.2000)". Relying on Sisters, Branch and Reaves contend that their contracts do not affect interstate commerce sufficiently to invoke the applicability of the FAA. We disagree.</p>
<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Sisters involved a contract between the Sisters of the Visitation, operators of a “monastery and spiritual retreat in Mobile,” and Cochran Plastering Company, Inc. (“Cochran”), an Alabama corporation. Id. at 760." The contract required Cochran to “repair cracks in the plaster in the *746 ceilings and wall of the chapel, to cast and install plaster moldings, and to pin up all loose moldings with screws and washers.” Id. at 760."</p>
<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The Sisters commenced arbitration proceedings on the basis of an arbitration clause in the contract. Cochran sought to enjoin the arbitration proceedings, arguing, among other things, that the transaction did not have a nexus with interstate commerce sufficient to invoke the FAA. This Court agreed with Cochran, holding that the contract did not “substantially affect[ ] interstate commerce.” Id. at 766."</p>
<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">In so holding, we explained:</p>
<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Id. at 765.</p>
<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Regarding Cochran’s use of “tools and equipment,” we said:</p>
<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Id. at 766.</p>
<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Discussing the “services and materials” required by the contract, we said:</p>
<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Id. at 766.</p>
<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Also, we noted that “the object of the services provided by Cochran,” that is, the chapel and its repairs, was “incapable of subsequent movement across state lines or of otherwise having a subsequent substantial effect on interstate commerce.” Id. at 765.</p>
<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Finally, we considered the extent to which the contract was connected with, or implicated, other contractual relationships. In that connection, we said:</p>
<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Id. at 766–67 (emphasis added). We focused on the effect the subject contract would “in fact have on those other contracts.” Id. at 767 (emphasis added). There was no evidence—or contention—that the related contracts would be “disrupt[ed],” by “delays or distraction” associated with litigation. Id. at 767. We concluded that the FAA was inapplicable.</p>
<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">In this case, however, Branch and Reaves concede that American General was incorporated in Alabama by American General, Inc., “a large, multi-national corporation,” for the purpose of doing business in Alabama. Brief of Appellee Branch, at 9 n. 1; Brief of Appellee Reaves, at 8 n. 1. The headquarters of American General, Inc., are in Indiana. Affidavit testimony in the record indicates that “the money which [American General] provides as loans to its customers is made available to [American General] through an affiliated corporation, American General Finance Corporation (“AGFC”), an Indiana corporation also headquartered in Indiana.” (Clerk’s Record in Case 1990888, at 76.) “The money is sent to [American General] ... from AGFC’s bank account located outside Alabama, and when payments are made by customers to [American General], those funds are ultimately sent out of state to AGFC’s bank accounts as repayment of the funds previously furnished to [American General].” Id.</p>
<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Merit, through which American General allegedly sold credit-life insurance to Branch, is an Indiana corporation headquartered in Indiana. Id. at 74. Yosemite, through which American General sold credit-disability and credit-property insurance to Branch, is incorporated in California and headquartered in Indiana. Id. at 75. “Some of the employees who work at the [American General] branch offices are also licensed agents of Merit and Yosemite.” Id. When a customer purchases credit insurance in connection with a loan from American General, he or she “is issued a certificate of insurance from either Merit or Yosemite, which certificate had been previously sent to the American General offices in Alabama.” Id. “Information about each customer is gathered in the Alabama branch offices and then transmitted to Merit’s or Yosemite’s headquarters in Indiana, where it is stored in a computer data base.” Id. Indeed, the corporate relationships involved here generate precisely the complex interstate commercial activity that we expressly noted was absent in Sisters.</p>
<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">These cases are also diametrically opposed to Sisters in that there, “the object of the services”—the chapel and its repairs—was “incapable of subsequent movement across state lines or of otherwise having a subsequent substantial effect on interstate commerce.” 775 So.2d at 765. Here, the object of the transaction—the loan proceeds—was intrinsically mobile. In other words, the proceeds enabled Branch and Reaves subsequently to purchase goods and services that traveled in interstate commerce.</p>
<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">We need not belabor the issue to conclude that these transactions substantially affected interstate commerce. See Staples v. Money Tree, Inc., 936 F.Supp. 856, 858 (M.D.Ala.1996) (loan transaction negotiated in Alabama involved interstate commerce where the lender was a Georgia corporation; loan proceeds were “wired from Georgia and then disbursed ... in Alabama; all supplies for the Alabama Money Tree office were shipped from Georgia; and all loan documents were printed in Georgia”). Indeed, Branch and Reaves have cited no case holding that loan transactions resembling those involved *748 here did not affect interstate commerce for purposes of the FAA. Consequently, we conclude that these contracts invoke the FAA.</p>
<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">A threshold question in the discussion of whether these arbitration agreements were unconscionable is whether that determination is to be made by the court or by the arbitrator. The arbitration clause in Branch’s contract purports to stipulate that the arbitrator is to decide the threshold issues of arbitrability, such as whether the arbitration clause itself is unconscionable. Of course, that is the defendants’ position.</p>
<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">[3] Nevertheless, “a determination that, by the terms of the arbitration clause, the arbitrator is to decide issues of arbitrability does not end the inquiry.” Green Tree Fin. Corp. v. Wampler, 749 So.2d 409, 413 (Ala.1999). “Where the attack is addressed to the arbitration clause itself, as opposed to the contract as a whole, the court, and not the arbitrator, resolves the issue.” Id. Thus, the threshold “issue of unconscionability of an arbitration clause is a question for the court and not the arbitrator.” Id. at 415 (emphasis added). See also Ex parte Napier, 723 So.2d 49 (Ala.1998); Ex parte Dan Tucker Auto Sales, Inc., 718 So.2d 33, 41 (Ala.1998) (Lyons, J., concurring specially).</p>
<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Branch and Reaves contend that the arbitration clauses were, themselves, unconscionable. Indeed, that was the only question addressed by the trial court, and that is the only substantive issue before this Court. The trial court did not err, therefore, in holding that it would determine whether the arbitration clauses are unconscionable. Thus, we shall proceed to consider whether the trial court erred in concluding that the clauses were unconscionable as to both Branch and Reaves.</p>
<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">[4] [5] The trial court’s order sets out in general terms the conditions under which a contract may be held to be unconscionable. More specifically, it discussed and applied the Layne v. Garner factors, namely: “(1) whether there was an absence of meaningful choice on one party’s part, (2) whether the contractual terms are unreasonably favorable to one party, (3) whether there was unequal bargaining power among the parties, and (4) whether there were oppressive, one-sided or patently unfair terms in the contract.” 612 So.2d at 408. For ease of discussion, we can reduce the Layne v. Garner test further to one comprised of two essential elements: (1) terms that are grossly favorable to a party that has (2) overwhelming bargaining power. Where these elements are present, Alabama courts will intervene under the guidance of § 5–19–16. Applying these factors, we conclude that the arbitration clause in Branch’s contract is unconscionable.</p>
<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The first indicium of unconscionability is the breadth of the clause. The arbitration provision in Branch’s contract is unusually broad in scope and application. It applies to every “dispute[ ] or controversy[ ] ... relating to” every actual or potential transaction—whether past, present, or future—and to every person, whether signatory or nonsignatory to any document, involved in such a transaction between the parties. (Emphasis added.) Thus, it applies to every cause of action that could conceivably arise in favor of Branch, and to every individual against whom a claim could conceivably be brought. This Court has often recognized that the phrase “relating to” is one of the broadest of the coverage provisions. *749 Beaver Constr. Co. v. Lakehouse, L.L.C., 742 So.2d 159, 165 (Ala.1999); Green Tree Fin. Corp. of Alabama v. Vintson, 753 So.2d 497 (Ala.1999); Kenworth of Dothan, Inc. v. Bruner–Wells Trucking, Inc., 745 So.2d 271 (Ala.1999); Ex parte Conference America, Inc., 713 So.2d 953 (Ala.1998); Reynolds &amp; Reynolds Co. v. King Autos., Inc., 689 So.2d 1 (Ala.1996); Ex parte Gates, 675 So.2d 371 (Ala.1996); Old Republic Ins. Co. v. Lanier, 644 So.2d 1258 (Ala.1994).</p>
<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">A second indicium of unconscionability is the provision purporting to invest the arbitrator with the threshold issues of arbitrability. “Such authority of the arbitrator to determine its own authority may itself be an indicium of unconscionability.” Brilliant Homes, Ltd. v. Lind, 722 So.2d 753, 755 (Ala.1998) (Lyons, J., concurring in the result).</p>
<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">A third indicium is the provision exempting the Lenders from the duty to arbitrate and expressly reserving for them the right to try to a jury their claims against Branch up to $10,000. Practically speaking, this provision benefits only the Lenders. In other words, American General reserved for itself the right to collect by judicial action the loan payments—the only species of claim it would ever realistically be expected to assert against Branch—while requiring Branch to settle by arbitration claims such as breach of contract and fraud—the species of claims she would most likely assert against the Lenders.</p>
<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">[6] More than once, this Court has expressed concern about such provisions. In Northcom, Ltd. v. James, 694 So.2d 1329 (Ala.1997), two Justices stated in the main opinion:</p>
<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Id. at 1338. In Ex parte McNaughton, 728 So.2d 592 (Ala.1998), cert. denied sub nom. McNaughton v. United Healthcare Servs., Inc., 528 U.S. 818, 120 S.Ct. 59, 145 L.Ed.2d 52 (1999), we disapproved that rationale; however, in Ex parte Parker, 730 So.2d 168, 171 (Ala.1999), we said: “The Parkers’ argument has merit to the extent that the lack of mutuality of remedy can be one factor, along with others, that a court may consider in determining whether an arbitration clause is unconscionable.” Thus, the absence of mutuality of remedy is still relevant in an unconscionability analysis. See Green Tree Fin. Corp. v. Wampler, 749 So.2d 409, 416 (Ala.1999) (“while the agreement restricts the Wamplers to arbitration while reserving to Green Tree the option to litigate, this fact, standing alone, is not sufficient to warrant a finding of  unconscionability”).</p>
<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">This provision is particularly significant in view of the companion provision purporting to limit the right of the arbitrator to award an amount “exceed[ing] five times the amount of economic loss.” (Emphasis added.) This limitation includes not only punitive damages, but all species of noneconomic loss, such as mental anguish. It goes without saying that such damages may be recovered in litigation. Under these contracts, the arbitrator “cannot award the full panoply of relief available in state courts under Alabama law.” Roberson v. Money Tree of Alabama, Inc., 954 F.Supp. 1519, 1526 (M.D.Ala.1997).</p>
<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Although the Roberson court held that the arbitration provision at issue was not unconscionable, it expressly noted that the contract did not limit the amount recoverable in arbitration. Id. Significantly, it further stated: “The court therefore does not *750 have before it whether a contract that not only requires the borrower to arbitrate any claim, while reserving for the lender the right to seek judicial remedies in the eventuality of default, but also restricts the borrower’s range of relief in arbitration, is unconscionable.” Id. n. 8 (emphasis added). See also Wampler, 749 So.2d at 415 (one indicium of unconscionability is the “oppressiveness or unfairness of the mechanism of arbitration”).</p>
<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">That, of course, is this case. It is one in which the Lenders have reserved for themselves the right to full redress for their claims, but denied that right to Branch. In other words, the contract limits not only the right to a specific forum, but the right to a remedy itself.</p>
<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">In that respect, this case differs fundamentally from others in which we have upheld clauses reserving for one party the right to litigate, but restricting the other party to arbitration. For example, in Napier, supra, the pertinent provision stated: “The parties agree and understand that the arbitrator shall have all powers provided by the law and the Contract. These powers shall include all legal and equitable remedies including, but not limited to, money damages, declaratory relief and injunctive relief.” 723 So.2d at 51 (emphasis added). See also Ex parte Parker, 730 So.2d at 170 (functionally identical provision); Green Tree Fin. Corp. v. Vintson, 753 So.2d 497, 500 (same); Ex parte Smith, 736 So.2d 604 (Ala.1999) (same).</p>
<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">In short, the arbitration provisions in this contract are so grossly favorable to the Lenders as to pass the first prong of the simplified Layne v. Garner test.2 Thus, it remains only to be determined whether Branch had any meaningful choice.</p>
<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">[7] A primary indicium of unconscionability in the modern consumer-transaction context is whether the consumer has the ability “to obtain the product made the basis of [the] action” without signing an arbitration clause. Wampler, 749 So.2d at 415. In this connection, Branch testified by affidavit:</p>
<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Moreover, the record contains evidence indicating that when Branch acquired her loans from American General on July 3, 1996; October 18, 1996; and November 21, 1997, the market was virtually closed to consumers seeking comparable financing without agreeing to arbitration provisions.</p>
<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">The record contains stipulations and affidavit testimony of 8 of the 16 companies (the 8 including American General) that were listed in the advertising pages of the Southern Directory Company telephone directory for the City of Tuscaloosa under the heading “Financing.”3 The other seven *751 companies are Associates Financial Services Company of Alabama, Inc.; TranSouth Financial Corporation; AVCO Financial Services of Alabama, Inc.; First Family Financial Services, Inc.; City Finance Company of Alabama, Inc.; Norwest Financial Alabama, Inc.; and Household Finance Corporation of Alabama. Of these companies, only Household Finance Corporation of Alabama “did not routinely enter into arbitration agreements in connection with its loans during the 1994–97 time frame.” Norwest Financial Alabama, Inc., and AVCO Financial Services of Alabama, Inc., began requiring loan applicants to sign arbitration agreements in August 1995. Associates Financial Services Company of Alabama, Inc.; TranSouth Financial Corporation; and First Family Financial Services, Inc., began requiring loan applicants to sign arbitration agreements in May 1996. City Finance Company of Alabama, Inc., began requiring loan applicants to sign arbitration agreements in October 1996.4</p>
<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Thus, when Branch applied for her November 21, 1997, loan, only one of the entities, namely, Household Finance Corporation of Alabama, did not require loan applicants to agree to arbitrate. Indeed, when she applied to American General for her first loan on July 3, only two of the companies, namely, Household Finance Corporation of Alabama, and City Finance Company of Alabama, Inc., did not require arbitration agreements.</p>
<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">We note that “[e]ntire segments of the market for certain goods and services ... are being closed to consumers who are unwilling to forfeit the rights guaranteed them by the federal and state constitutions.” Allstar Homes, Inc. v. Waters, 711 So.2d 924, 933 (Ala.1997) (Cook, J., concurring specially), rejected on other grounds, Ex parte Perry, 744 So.2d 859 (Ala.1999). In order to meet her burden of proof on this issue, a consumer need not show that the market was completely closed, only that she was unable to acquire goods or services without considerable expenditure of time and resources. Branch has made such a showing in this case. From the sample responses of the companies providing the kind of financing for which Branch was shopping in her geographical area, it follows that only 1 or 2 companies out of 16 might have allowed her to borrow money in November 1997 without agreeing to arbitrate. Branch would have had to expend considerable time and effort even to find these companies. Because the evidence demonstrates that Branch had no meaningful choice, the second Layne v. Garner factor is satisfied.</p>
<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">For these reasons, we conclude that the trial court did not err in holding the arbitration provisions in Branch’s contract to be unconscionable and unenforceable. The order in case 1990887 is affirmed.</p>
<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">[8] [9] The foregoing analysis as to Branch’s case would seem to require a similar result in Reaves’s case. Unlike Branch, however, Reaves cannot demonstrate that she was unable to acquire goods or services without considerable expenditure of time and resources. This is so because Reaves obtained her last loan from American General on November 2, 1995. At that time, finance companies in her geographical location requiring agreements to arbitrate were still a distinct *752 minority.5 Thus, for all that appears in the record, one must conclude that she could—with a minimum of effort—have acquired financing without agreeing to arbitrate her claims.</p>
<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">In fact, she testified that she had borrowed money from “Citizens Bank” in Greensboro on two occasions since 1995 and that neither transaction involved an arbitration agreement. Moreover, she testified that, in seeking the loan of November 2, 1995, she contacted no entity other than American General. In other words, she did not shop around for a loan that did not involve an agreement to arbitrate. She testified that she asked no questions about the arbitration provisions in the Note and Security Agreement. Indeed, she testified that she did not read the Note and Security Agreement. Consequently, she has not demonstrated that she had no meaningful choice; therefore, the second Layne v. Garner factor is not satisfied in her case.</p>
<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">For these reasons, we conclude that the trial court erred in holding that Reaves’s arbitration agreement was unconscionable. The order in case 1990888 is, therefore, reversed, and that case is remanded.</p>
<p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">In summary, the order in the Branch case is affirmed. The order in the Reaves case is reversed and the case is remanded.</p>
